Public repo for BRAND: Bayesian  Robust  Adaptive  Novelty Detector. 

This repository is associated with the paper Denti, Cappozzo, Greselin (2021) *A two-stage Bayesian semiparametric model for novelty detection with robust prior information.* [https://doi.org/10.1007/s11222-021-10017-7](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11222-021-10017-7). We provide here the code for replicating the simulation study and real data analyses of Section 6.

For the actual implementation of the methods described in the paper, an R package that proves efficient Slice Samplers for handling both multivariate and functional data, can be found at [this](https://github.com/Fradenti/Brand) repository
